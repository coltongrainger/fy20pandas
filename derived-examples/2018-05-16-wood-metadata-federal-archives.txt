> Description:
>
> Abstract: This data is focused on the large-scale recovery of Arctic
> and North Pacific historical environmental data---amounting to
> millions of individual observations---and making them available for
> new research, such as extended retrospective analysis (reanalysis) to
> study a range of lower-frequency climate phenomena and better
> understand their impact on the Arctic environment. This Excel
> spreadsheet is a manifest of approximately 105,000 high resolution
> digital images of selected vessel logbooks that were digitized by
> National Archives and University of Washington staff and
> student-interns from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016 at imaging stations
> at the National Archives (in Washington, D.C. and College Park, MD
> locations). The original manuscripts are held at Archives 1 and 2, and
> the U.S. National Archives (NARA) maintains the digital images on the
> NARA computer system accessible via the national catalog. The temporal
> range of the collection spans 1850 to 1961 and includes archival
> assets for federal vessels, including the US Navy, Coast Guard/Revenue
> Cutter Service, Coast Survey, and logbooks of Russian-American Company
> ships transferred during the purchase of Alaska in 1867. Geographic
> coverage is global, with an emphasis on the North Pacific and Arctic.
> The information contained in the digitized vessel logbooks includes
> historical weather, sea ice, and other environmental observations of
> the Arctic. This collection is an extension of digitizing effort that
> began under NPRB Project 1124, Environmental data rescue in the North
> Pacific and Arctic through a citizen-science initiative, and NPRB
> Project 1226, Crowdsourcing large-scale environmental data recovery
> for the North Pacific -- Arctic region from 1850 to the satellite era,
> and NPRB 1322, Large-scale environmental data recovery and analysis
> for the North Pacific -- Arctic region.
>
> Purpose:
>
> This dataset was produced to facilitate the large-scale recovery and
> reanalysis of Arctic weather and environmental data contained in these
> logbooks. Transcription of historical weather, sea ice, and other
> environmental observations from manuscript images to digital format is
> being carried out by Old Weather (www.oldweather.org), a citizen
> science project managed by the Zooniverse (www.zooniverse.org), on
> behalf of a broad consortium of organizations. Environmental data
> extracted via Old Weather are quality controlled at the UK Met Office
> Hadley Centre and then blended into the appropriate global databases
> (e.g. International Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set; ICOADS).
>
> Supplemental-Information:
>
> The image collection generated by this project is available via the US
> National Archives Catalog system. Notice will be provided as
> transcriptions and quality-controlled data extracted from the
> manuscript logbooks are integrated into publicly available databases.

> The quality and accuracy of the images are checked at several stages
> during the imaging workflow. Initially, the person capturing the
> logbook images for a vessel does a quick check by looking at JPEG
> images appearing in the Digital Professional software after the shoot,
> or by looking at the images appearing in the ACDSee software. Next,
> after the images are processed and divided chronologically into
> various size folders (e.g., monthly or annual), an initial audit of at
> least ten percent of the images is performed to verify that no image
> has been left out and each image is straight, rotated correctly, and
> has proper cropping, exposure, color balance, etc. If there are more
> than three errors in any of the audited boxes or volumes of the
> logbook images, then all of the remaining images for that vessel will
> be audited for quality and accuracy. If the initial audit finds three
> or less errors per box or volume of the logbooks, then the rest of the
> images for that vessel will only be spot-checked. However, the first
> time a newly-trained member captures images of a vessel's logbooks,
> all of the images from that vessel are audited.

> refers to the top level of arrangement used by the National Archives: "In the National Archives, records of the Federal government are arranged in numbered record groups (RG), with each record group comprising the records of a major government entity, usually a bureau or an independent agency" (http://www.ourarchives.wikispaces.net/Record+Groups).
For example, four record groups (RG 23, RG 24, RG 26 and 261) are referenced on the Excel spreadsheet.
Logbooks of U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey ships are found in RG 23, 
logbooks of U.S. Navy ships are found in RG 24, Records of the Bureau of Naval Personnel, 
and logbooks of U.S. Coast Guard ships are found in RG 26, Records of the U.S. Coast Guard. 
Logbooks of the Russian-American Company are found in RG 261.
